# tv-show-search
A simple project using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and bootstrap for the styling, to create a search application that allows the user to input the name of a TV show and be presented with cards that contain results from the tvmaze.com api. This project was based on a task from the Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy by Colt Steele, but modified 
to be styled and return more types of data for the user.
